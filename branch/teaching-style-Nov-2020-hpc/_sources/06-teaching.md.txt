# Practicing teaching and feedback

Goals of this exercise:

- In groups of 4-5 persons we will practice teaching a **5-minute segment
  of a lesson of your choice**.
- You don't have to follow the current material line by line but ideally take a topic that is
  present or missing in the CodeRefinery curriculum.
- We will practice giving constructive feedback.
- We will practice improving our 5-minute segment by taking the feedback into account.
- In both session you can teach the same topic/segment but if you prefer you can also
  change the topic/aspect for the second session.

> ## Exercise part 1 (group rooms, 90 minutes): First round of 5-minute teaching demos
>
> - We organize the breakout rooms to not only discuss one lesson/topic so that it is more interesting
>   to listen and also probably we will all get more useful feedback.
> - Give each other **constructive verbal feedback** on the teaching demos.
> - Write down questions (in the collaborative document) that you would like to
>   discuss in the main room or interesting conclusions which you would like to
>   share with others.

> ## Discussion (main room, 20 minutes)
>
> - We discuss questions and conclusions which came up during the group work session.

> ## Exercise part 2 (group rooms, 90 minutes): Second round of 5-minute teaching demos
>
> - In the second round we distribute the rooms differently so that you can
>   present it to a **new group of workshop participants** and can receive new
>   feedback.
> - Ask for feedback and one/few point(s) you want to improve.
> - In your second trial check whether you feel the demonstration improved.
> - Share your lessons learned in the collaborative document.
> - Give us also feedback on this exercise format. Was it useful? What can we improve?

> ## Optional exercise/discussion: Feedback for two live-coding examples
>
> Teaching by live coding is a
> [performance art which requires practice](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:performance-exercises).
> This exercise highlights some typical pitfalls that most instructors
> fall into sooner or later, and also shows how to avoid them.
> Watch closely since we will be giving feedback!
> - Watch these two videos: [video 1](https://youtu.be/bXxBeNkKmJE) and
>   Then watch [video 2](https://youtu.be/SkPmwe_WjeY)
> - What was better in video 1 and what was better in video 2?
> - Please give feedback in the shared workshop document.
